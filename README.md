# PalaeographyExample_ODD
A small ODD containing a proposed standard format for sharing palaeographical examples using TEI and IIIF. While nothing in the code is itself particularly novel, the intent is to propose a standardized format that will facilitate sharing across projects.

Note that while, technically, the use of the <graphic> and <facsimile> elements means that this suggested format does not require the use of IIIF, provision of the examples through IIIF significantly facilitates the intended interoperability by making it trivial to reproduce the described elements in the context of other collections.
